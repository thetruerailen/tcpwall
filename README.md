# TCP Wall

## What is TCP Wall?

For those who are idiots, TCP wall allows you to forward a TCP service using our public node or someone elses private node they allow you to use and you can use our service to acsess it.

## Can I contribute?

Yes, please do. This bs needs security but I cant be bothered.
